### 1. Google Form

This is the [Self-Audit Form](https://docs.google.com/a/sunholdings.net/forms/d/1m-N2uCmuza-nMP9X3PIZB8qMbnnpd9BxMiC8mz67CuU/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true) that gets filled out by the FOMs. 
The images that are uploaded on the Form are automatically saved in the folder called [Self-Audit(File Responses)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0BxQ3K2juRI2NfnVOWHB6SG1FcEkyeVhlUGs5bjRfT2ZCWURDZ096ZTZUa2FnMU1zaDBWVEU) inside the Google Drive. 
The images get automatically erased every monday at 1pm with the script called [DeleteOldFiles](https://script.google.com/u/2/home/projects/1gGI8fYGYa8lIixd66IehKsnfjRVIK-XO_GW0U16wtsqtE51i20u_XzIp).


### 2. Google Forms Responses

All the Google Form responses get saves inside this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQH0ohoGL4ipzDssMKqES6Sr1j1c5nLW-IQ6-oyxFdQ/edit#gid=1811552042) which is connected with PowerBI.


### 3. PowerBI


The PowerBI calculates the final grade of each Self-Audit submitted. It also analyzes the information and gives insights. The details of the calculation process is explained below on the **PowerBI** section.



### 4. Template

This Google Sheet is the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gQK_dDIeZ1Z_eRhKFbk8r1Si3okPYFzCQvTEWvB5kzc/edit#gid=0) that gets filled out with the Self-Audit form responses and is automatically sent to the respondent. Inside this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1qnvGT02BzwtajvY8zGM2tZFmyaOoo0Qp) all the PDFs get saved.



### 5. Points Table

Inside this table you can find the points for every type of question in the form. This [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nH52f3ZHGg2MdTU5Mrznw-VtgGRG9F_kuj0dVM-4jY/edit#gid=0) is connected with PowerBI, so if there is any change with weight per question, this Google Sheets needs to be modified.**
